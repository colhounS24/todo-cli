# To-Do List CLI (Python)

Minimal, file-backed to-do list CLI.

Install locally (editable) to get a `todo` command:

```bash
python -m pip install -e .
```

Then run:

```bash
todo add "Write report"
todo list
todo complete 0
todo remove 0
todo clear
```

Add with a due date:

```bash
todo add "Finish budget" --due 2026-02-15
todo add "Call client" --due tomorrow
```

If `todo` is not found, ensure your Python's `Scripts` directory is on your PATH (Windows) or use the same Python executable: `python -m todo`.

Run tests:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pytest -q
```

Publishing to PyPI
------------------

Quick outline to publish a release (recommended: use GitHub Actions):

1. Create an account on https://pypi.org/ and generate an API token at https://pypi.org/manage/account/
2. In your GitHub repo, add the token as a repository secret named `PYPI_API_TOKEN`.
3. Create a git tag for the release (match pattern `vX.Y.Z`) and push it:

```bash
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
```

The included GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/publish.yml` will build and publish the package automatically when a tag is pushed or a release is created.

Local publish (if you prefer to upload from your machine):

Windows PowerShell:
```powershell
setx PYPI_API_TOKEN "<token>"
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
./scripts/publish_local.ps1
```

Linux / macOS:
```bash
export PYPI_API_TOKEN="<token>"
./scripts/publish_local.sh
```

Notes:
- The GitHub Action expects a secret named `PYPI_API_TOKEN` containing a PyPI API token.
- Publishing requires that the `name` and `version` in `pyproject.toml` are ready for release and not already on PyPI.
- I cannot publish to PyPI for you without your PyPI token and pushing tags to a remote repo; I added automation so the upload is a single secure step once you provide the token in GitHub secrets.
